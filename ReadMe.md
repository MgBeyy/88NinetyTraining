This repository showcases simple projects I completed during the training portion of my internship at 88Ninety LLC.

**SQL:**  
- Designed a `UniversityDB` database with six interrelated tables.
- Populated the tables with sample data.
- Practiced SQL operations such as `SELECT`, `JOIN`, and others to retrieve and display information.

**Entity Framework (EF):**  
- Rebuilt the `UniversityDB` schema using Entity Framework.
- Added data to the tables through EF.
- Explored querying techniques using methods like `ToList()`, `Include()`, and additional EF capabilities.
